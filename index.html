                  <p>This canopy net is just what I was looking for! I wanted one that would keep mosquitoes out and yet look fancy and this is it. It was pretty simple to put up. I like the overlaps because it certainly keeps unwanted insects out. It reaches all the way to the floor, but at night, I like tuck the bottom a bit under the mattress.</p>
